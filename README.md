# Dotfiles

> About as close as I can get to directly interfacing with the machines.

This is my shell configuration, use it at your own peril.

## Configuration

Power tools I like to keep handy:
- Zsh
- Vim 
- tmux

## Usage

There's no fancy setup script that will symlink your `$HOME` like its life depends on it.
This approach was taken from this [awesome article from Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).
To install, just follow the steps at the end of this article. Ensure you backup any existing dotfiles, unless you're really
brave.
